The TheoToys Logo (Colored, Gray, Monochrome) is an original work by Tehoor
Marjan. Description: This logo features a spinning top (toupie) with a beige
tip, set inside a circular white background representing a pearl. The pearl is
splashing out of stylized blue waves, suggesting motion and energy. The overall
design conveys playfulness, dynamism, and a sense of movement, symbolizing
creativity, innovation and amusement.

The TheoToys Logo may not be used, copied, modified, or distributed in any form
without prior written permission from the copyright holder. In particular, this
logo may not be used to suggest endorsement, partnership, or affiliation with
any product, service, or organization other than TheoToys.

Explanation

While most of my work is shared openly and under permissive licenses, a logo is
different: it serves as a unique identifier of TheoToys and of my personal
work. For that reason, the logo itself cannot be reused, redistributed, or
applied to other projects, products, or services in a way that could cause
confusion or imply endorsement.

Permission for Inspiration & Derivatives

You are welcome to draw inspiration from this logo and create derivative works,
provided that your final design is clearly distinct and cannot reasonably be
mistaken for the TheoToys Logo. In other words: use the ideas, not the
identity.
